=head1 NAME

Locale::Po4a::Wml - convert WML (web markup language) documents from/to PO files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The po4a (PO for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and more
interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using gettext tools on
areas where they were not expected like documentation.

Locale::Po4a::Wml is a module to help the translation of WML documents into
other [human] languages. Do not mixup the WML we are speaking about here
(web markup language) and the WAP crap used on cell phones.

Please note that this module relies upon the Locale::Po4a::Xhtml
module, which also relies upon the Locale::Po4a::Xml module.  This
means that all tags for web page expressions are assumed to be written
in the XHTML syntax.

=head1 OPTIONS ACCEPTED BY THIS MODULE

NONE.

=head1 STATUS OF THIS MODULE

This module works for some simple documents, but is still young.
Currently, the biggest issue of the module is probably that it cannot
handle documents that contain non-XML inline tags such as <email
"foo@example.org">, which are often defined in the WML.  Improvements
will be added in the future releases.
