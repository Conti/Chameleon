    PrivateBootInfo has fields used by the booter that used to be part of

    completely changed to boot_args *bootArgs. This (new to boot-132) structure

    uses internally. Some fields (e.g. the video information) remain interesting
    to the kernel and are thus located in bootArgs although with different field names.
