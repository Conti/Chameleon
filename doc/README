                        Chameleon Boot Loader
                        =====================

  What is it?
  -----------

  Chameleon is combination of various boot loader components. It is based
  on David Elliott's fake EFI implementation added to Apple's boot-132
  project. Chameleon is extended with the following key features:
  

  Features
  --------
  
   - Device Property Injection via device-properties string in org.chameleon.Boot.plist
   - hybrid boot0+boot1h loaders for both MBR and GPT partitioned disks.
   - automatic FSB detection code even for recent AMD CPUs.
   - Apple Software RAID support.
   - stage2 loader (boot) can be placed as a regular file in the boot
     partition's root folder.
   - Modules
     

                        Installation
                        ============
  
  Normal Install (non-RAID):
  --------------------------
  
  Suppose that your installation is on /dev/disk0s2
  
   - Install boot0 to the MBR:
   		sudo ./fdisk440 -f boot0 -u -y /dev/rdisk0
  
   - Install boot1h to the partition's bootsector:
  		sudo dd if=boot1h of=/dev/rdisk0s2
  
   - Install boot to the partition's root directory:
  		sudo cp boot /
  
  No need to use startupfiletool anymore!
  
  
  RAID Install:
  -------------
  
  Suppose that your installation is on /dev/disk3, which is either a mirror- or a
  stripeset consisting of /dev/disk0 and /dev/disk1

  Mac OS X creates a small helper partition at the end of each RAID member disk,
  namely /dev/disk0s3 and /dev/disk1s3
  
   - Install boot0 to the MBR of both disks:
  		sudo ./fdisk440 -f boot0 -u -y /dev/rdisk0
  		sudo ./fdisk440 -f boot0 -u -y /dev/rdisk1
  
   - Install boot1h to the bootsector of each boot partition:
  		sudo dd if=boot1h of=/dev/rdisk0s3
  		sudo dd if=boot1h of=/dev/rdisk1s3
  
   - Install boot to both helper partition's root directories.
  		diskutil mount disk0s3
  		cp boot /Volumes/Boot\ OSX
  		diskutil unmount disk0s3
  		diskutil mount disk1s3
  		cp boot /Volumes/Boot\ OSX
  		diskutil unmount disk1s3
