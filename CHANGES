- cparm : Added a workaroud for Xcode 4.4.x compatibility 504B030414030100630004731141000000007D0000008B00000003000B0062696E01990700020041450308001AED80DA50DF6080B0390FE095B3BC129E1FC27C104EC97897EF27CD1175766CB18C66FF42EFB7023911BDFD5E4BC9AEEC32FF3473963F70B255581D7B74DE9F
- cparm : Fixed a buffer overflow in the plist loader
- cparm : Ported the nvidia plist helper (less time to spend on the device id more time to code :-) )
- cparm : Added a Sata module, known as YellowIconFixer in my branch, useful to fix yellow icon issue (can also fix an issue with the apple's dvd player application in moutain lion)
  , for now not added in the pkg script !!! 

- cparm : Ported the OS detection to the trunk, updated the default theme to v 1.1 (credit to blackosx) 

- Added AtiPorts option to GraphicsEnabler, so users can override the default number of ports. It proved
  to be useful when used to limit the number of ports that a framebuffer registers, which seems to be a
  requirement on laptops that can only use 2 ports at the same time.
  Thanks to Akbar for testing and AniV also for the tip:
    http://forum.voodooprojects.org/index.php/topic,1959.msg10402.html#msg10402
- Added NVidia ION AHCI controllers dev id to AHCIPortInjector kext.
  Forgot to mention source on the commit: http://forum.voodooprojects.org/index.php/topic,1170.0.html
- Renamed com.apple.Boot.plist to org.chameleon.Boot.plist.
- Added "ShowInfo" key (enabled by default for now), which enables/disables the display of
  partition and resolution related info, on the Gui.
  This info may not play well with some custom themes.
- Modules can now be selected between not compiled, compiled into chameleon, or compiled as modules.
- New makefile + configuration system.
- Added the BOOT2_MAX_LENGTH constant in memory.h. This is now used in mboot.c to relocate the correct
  number of bytes for boot2.
- Added new ATi/AMD Graphics Card Enabler.
- Added new SMBIOS patcher.
	Includes changes to "manufacter" keys, from SM*manufacter to SM*manufacturer.
- Added module system.
- Added automatic P-States & C-States generation for native power management.
- Added Booter Log Dump Tool
- Added Booter message Logging (":/boot-log" ioreg property)
- Removed -x32 option, use arch=i386 instead
- Added automatic SMBusspeed detection for lga1156 core i5/7 cpus
- Added new iMac11,1 sbios default model for lga1156 core i5/17 mobos
- md0 code. Notified xnu when an md ramdisk is specified
- Added rollover image support for selected device icons.
  Use device_<type>_o.png in theme folder. Credits goes to Blackosx.
- Revisited theme resource embedding. Using the device_<type> icons are optional with
  the exception of device_generic.
- Optimized memory detection speed
- Added displaying source device and partition number for file read operations.
- Increased boot2's maximum size from 383.5k to 447.5k.
  Updated stage 1 loaders for handling the new size limit.
- Added alternate format for setting the default partition. The user can specify the selected
  volume UUID for the "Default Partition" key.
- Implemented SPD memory automatic detection and injection,seems to work really great ...
- Factorized code to prepare a dynamic memory detection algorithm ...
- Optimized smbios table address search
- Optimized cursor spinout in textmode if no verbose mode is set
- Added ram table structures definitions
- Added getSmbios() a param permitting to select between orig and new smbios entries
- Changed "Default Partition" behavior to accept only native system volumes or foreign partitions.
- Added NVIDIA new NVCAP customization support and support for ION gfx cards from aserebln
- Added ATI new framebuffers support and new cards from PCEFI10.6
- improved ACPI file search algo by implementing a cache.
- Nvidia injection fix
- pciroot would not always return correct UID in auto detection mode
- Fixed the hibernation problem in boot2/resume.c
- Fixed all new booter versions with SystemType would override the facp value even if correct,
  now keeps the facp value if correct and no override has been done, implemented a best effort algo.
  for maximizing the chance to get the most correct value before we decide to use a fixed value (1=desktop)
- Fixed display cosmetics of UUID, now a convert.c file contains all 
  conversions api, to be completed by function that we should reuse.
  
- Fixed SystemType would be always forced to a value, now optionally changed
  only if overridden
- Kept SystemID as the only option to change manually the system-id 
  For theses reasons, SystemId from bootConfig and SMUUID from smbiosConfig are now DEPRECATED.

- Integrated JrCs fadt patch (kept for RC5 the existing DSDT.aml  retry algo that disappeared in his patch,
  should be more discussed for RC6)
- Added JrCs modified convention name change to coding_standards
- Now malloc (ex. MALLOC in Asere patch) is renamed malloc(size) and is an alias 
  to safe_malloc(size, file, line) with _FILE_ and _LINE_ preprocessor definitions
- Added a new 'Rename Partition Feature', now permitting to rename partition 
  like 'System reserved' to a more meaningful name
- Added SystemID option permitting to change the System UUID to a fixed value.
- Added the PciRoot auto detection feature imported from pcefi10.5
- Added automatic "system-id" injection from dmi bios, also compatible 
  with SystemID boot option and former SMUUID from smbios,plist
- Added "system-type' automatic injection (1=Desktop) plus override possibility 
  with the new system-type option in bootConfig
- Added SMserial and SMproductname new options for smbios.plist
- Merged with asere patch, while keeping my fake_efi.c changes, and adding a new 
  stringForKey() API, also changed the DT__XXXX() set of functions 
  to handle const char * values instead of char*.
